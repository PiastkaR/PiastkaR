Some of the projects are a kind of 'drafts' or 'coding diaries', thus please do not be discoureged hen seeing some ugly parts ðŸ˜„  There are repositories which comfirms with clean code priciples, just be patient and search for them along the others or drop me a line! ðŸ“« <br>
  <br>
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Java-Python Gen AI chatbot integration <br>
âš¡ I'm also a big fan of Warhmmer thus one can find unofficial apps related to the system and tabletop game  <br>
